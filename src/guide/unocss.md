# UnoCSS

- [UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev/): Instant on-demand atomic CSS engine
- [Interactive Docs](https://unocss.dev/interactive/): Interactive class name query documentation for UnoCSS
- [tailwindcss](https://www.tailwindcss.cn/docs/installation): Documentation for tailwindcss

Both UnoCSS and tailwindcss are very similar in terms of usage, but UnoCSS is lighter and more friendly for extension and customization. The UnoCSS documentation mainly focuses on configuration aspects, while the tailwindcss documentation mainly focuses on usage aspects. It is better to search for what specific class names to use in the tailwindcss documentation for a better experience.

Directly using the interactive query documentation for UnoCSS can be challenging because without a general understanding of the naming conventions, how can one know what to search for? Some abbreviations may not be apparent when searching for properties directly. The interactive documentation is more suitable for use after mastering the class naming conventions.

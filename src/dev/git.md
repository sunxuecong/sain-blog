# Git

Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to large projects with speed and efficiency.

Git is easy to learn, takes up minimal space, and performs lightning-fast. It surpasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features such as inexpensive local branching, convenient staging area, and multiple workflows.
